<h2 id="recent-favorite-books">Recent favorite books</h2>
<p>Find me exploring the pages of a good book. Some of my recent favorites include:</p>
<p><strong><em>The Dune (1-4)</em></strong>: Frank Herbert's epic sci-fi saga not only offers thrilling adventures but also delves into complex themes of power, ecology, and human potential. The intricate world-building and political intrigue in Dune resonate with my analytical mind. I just start the fifth book...</p>
<p><strong><em>Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes</em></strong>: Daniel Everett's account of living among the Pirahã people in the Amazonian jungle provides a fascinating glimpse into a culture with a unique language and worldview. This book challenged my assumptions about language and communication, much like data analysis challenges my preconceived notions about patterns and correlations. </p>
<p><strong><em>SQL Cookbook Query Solutions and Techniques for All SQL User</em></strong>: This practical guide by Anthony Molinaro and Robert de Graaf is my go-to reference for tackling complex SQL queries and optimizing database performance. It's a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of data analysis techniques.</p></p>
