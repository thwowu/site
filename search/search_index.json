I'm proficient in SQL, Python, and a variety of data engineering tools (AWS, Snowflake, dbt, Fivetran, etc.), and I'm always eager to learn and adopt new technologies. I've had the opportunity to work across diverse sectors, including education technology, creative industry, real-estate, and fintech, where I've seen firsthand the transformative power of data-driven insights. What Drives Me I'm passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and create positive change. Whether it's optimizing business processes, uncovering hidden patterns, or ensuring data privacy, I find fulfillment in knowing that my work has a tangible impact. I believe that effective data analysis is not just about numbers, but about storytelling. It's about finding the narrative within the data and communicating it in a way that resonates with stakeholders and inspires action. My Approach I take a collaborative and results-oriented approach to every project. I believe in building strong relationships with my clients and stakeholders, understanding their unique needs, and tailoring my solutions to their specific goals. I'm not afraid to roll up my sleeves and dive into the details, but I also have a keen eye for the bigger picture and can translate complex findings into clear, actionable recommendations. What Sets Me Apart Throughout my career, I've consistently delivered impactful results, such as: Automating data workflows : I've implemented solutions that save time, reduce errors, and empower stakeholders to access data independently. Optimizing data infrastructure : I've improved query performance, enhanced data quality, and reduced costs through strategic infrastructure improvements. Building insightful reports : I've developed reports and dashboards that provide clear, actionable insights to drive business decisions. Strong Communication : I can effectively translate technical concepts into language that anyone can understand. Passion for Learning : I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. Outside of work, I'm an avid language learner, currently dabbling in French and German. I find that the structure and logic of languages have parallels with the way I approach data analysis. I'm also passionate about museums and enjoy exploring the intersection of art, history, and technology. I find that the process of curating an exhibition shares similarities with data analysis \u2013 both involve carefully selecting and organizing information to reveal hidden patterns and tell compelling stories. Hobbies & Interests Data Exploration : I enjoy experimenting with different data visualization techniques to create engaging and informative presentations. Traveling : I love exploring new cultures and experiencing different perspectives. I believe that travel broadens our understanding of the world and enriches our lives. Museums and Museum Studies : I love visiting museums and learning about the art of curation. I'm particularly interested in how museums use technology to enhance the visitor experience and make collections more accessible. tools and stacks I'm proficient in a variety of data engineering tools and languages, including: Cloud Platforms : AWS (S3, Lambda, Redshift) Databases : Snowflake, PostgreSQL, Redshift Data Transformation : dbt, Fivetran Workflow Automation : Git, GitHub Actions, Jenkins Data Visualization : Tableau, Metabase Recent favorite books Find me exploring the pages of a good book. Some of my recent favorites include: Dune (1-4) : Frank Herbert's epic sci-fi saga not only offers thrilling adventures but also delves into complex themes of power, ecology, and human potential. The intricate world-building and political intrigue in Dune resonate with my analytical mind. And i haven't started the fifth book yet. Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes : Daniel Everett's account of living among the Pirah\u00e3 people in the Amazonian jungle provides a fascinating glimpse into a culture with a unique language and worldview. This book challenged my assumptions about language and communication, much like data analysis challenges my preconceived notions about patterns and correlations. SQL Cookbook Query Solutions and Techniques for All SQL User : This practical guide by Anthony Molinaro and Robert de Graaf is my go-to reference for tackling complex SQL queries and optimizing database performance. It's a testament to my commitment to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of data analysis techniques.","title":"About"},{"location":"nav/about/#about-me","text":"I'm a data expert on the entire data lifecycle, from designing and maintaining robust ETL/ELT pipelines to developing insightful reports and dashboards.
