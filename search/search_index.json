I'm TH, a data expert on the entire data lifecycle, from designing and maintaining robust ETL/ELT pipelines to developing insightful reports and dashboards. I'm proficient in SQL, Python, and a variety of data engineering tools (AWS, Snowflake, dbt, Fivetran, etc.), and I'm always eager to learn and adopt new technologies. I'm passionate about using my skills to solve real-world problems and make a positive impact. I've had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, from automating reporting processes to ensuring data privacy compliance, and even leading a complex database upgrade with zero downtime. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and approaches, and I'm constantly seeking out challenges that push me to grow. Throughout my career, I've consistently delivered impactful results, such as: - Automating data workflows : I've implemented solutions that save time, reduce errors, and empower stakeholders to access data independently. - Optimizing data infrastructure : I've improved query performance, enhanced data quality, and reduced costs through strategic infrastructure improvements. - Building insightful reports : I've developed reports and dashboards that provide clear, actionable insights to drive business decisions. Outside of work, I'm an avid language learner, currently dabbling in French and German. I find that the structure and logic of languages have parallels with the way I approach data analysis. I'm also passionate about museums and enjoy exploring the intersection of art, history, and technology. I find that the process of curating an exhibition shares similarities with data analysis \u2013 both involve carefully selecting and organizing information to reveal hidden patterns and tell compelling stories. Hobbies & Interests Data Exploration : I enjoy experimenting with different data visualization techniques to create engaging and informative presentations. Traveling : I love exploring new cultures and experiencing different perspectives. I believe that travel broadens our understanding of the world and enriches our lives. Museums and Museum Studies : I love visiting museums and learning about the art of curation. I'm particularly interested in how museums use technology to enhance the visitor experience and make collections more accessible. tools and stacks I'm proficient in a variety of data engineering tools and languages, including: Cloud Platforms : AWS (S3, Lambda, Redshift) Databases : Snowflake, PostgreSQL, Redshift Data Transformation : dbt, Fivetran Workflow Automation : Git, GitHub Actions, Jenkins Data Visualization : Tableau, Metabase Let's Connect! I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations.
